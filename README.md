 Personal Finance Tracker (Python)

The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a simple and practical Python project built to help users keep track of their income and expenses through a clean command-line interface (CLI).  
It’s a lightweight console-based application that stores your financial records locally, making it easy to manage your budget anytime — even without internet access.

This project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also focuses on **data validation**, **file handling**, and **modular design** to keep the system structured and easy to extend.
Features

Add Income or Expense
  Record your daily transactions with details such as amount, category, date, and description.

Auto Data Saving:
  Every time you add a transaction, it’s saved automatically in a text file (`finance_data.txt`) so nothing is lost when you exit.

Monthly Report Generation 
  View your total income and expenses for any month in `MM-YYYY` format with category-wise summaries.

All-Time Summary: 
  Get a quick snapshot of your total earnings, total spendings, and remaining balance.

Smart Date Handling:
  If you don’t enter a date, the system automatically picks today’s date.

Clean Console Interface:
  Simple text-based menus that make the application easy to navigate for everyone.

 What This Project Demonstrates

This project is not just about managing finances — it’s a great way to understand how **OOP principles** work in real-life applications.  
It also helps in learning **file handling**, **data validation**, and **layered architecture design** (Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Layer).


 *Demo (Example Usage)*
Here is what the main menu and a monthly report look like in the terminal:
